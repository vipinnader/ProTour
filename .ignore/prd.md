# Mobile Tournament Manager Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Reduce organizer administrative burden by 50% through automated real-time bracket updates and delegated score entry
- Achieve successful completion of 3-5 pilot tournaments in India within first 3 months post-launch  
- Deliver a 4.5+ star rating on Indian App Store and Google Play Store within 6 months
- Achieve +50 Net Promoter Score from players on live tournament experience
- Create a professional, mobile-first tournament experience that enhances club reputation
- Establish foundation for expansion into team-based sports and broader market reach

### Background Context

Local racket sports tournaments in India currently suffer from a fragmented management ecosystem built around outdated Windows-only desktop software, spreadsheets, and manual communication. This creates a single-person bottleneck where organizers are tethered to desks, resulting in stale public information, wasted court time, and constant player interruptions. The chaotic experience damages club reputations and hinders growth.

Our mobile-first solution addresses this by unifying management, participation, and spectating into a single real-time platform. The focus on the Indian market leverages the underserved local tournament space, with plans for CSV-based player imports initially and future integration with Indian payment gateways like Razorpay.

### Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS (None)**

**HIGH Priority:**
1. **User Research Validation Gap**: Need to validate UI assumptions with actual Indian tournament organizers
2. **Technical Risk Assessment**: Offline-first + multi-device sync complexity needs architect evaluation
3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Need specific performance criteria for Indian infrastructure conditions

**MEDIUM Priority:**
1. **Detailed User Journey Flows**: Primary user flows need more granular documentation
2. **Integration Specification**: SMS gateway and payment integration details need expansion
3. **Error Handling Scenarios**: More comprehensive error state documentation needed

**LOW Priority:**
1. **Content Strategy**: Tournament communication templates and user onboarding materials
2. **Competitive Analysis**: Deeper analysis of TournamentSoftware.com alternatives
3. **Analytics Requirements**: User behavior tracking and business intelligence needs

### MVP Scope Assessment

**✅ Appropriate MVP Features:**
- Tournament creation and CSV import (addresses core workflow)
- Real-time score entry and bracket updates (core differentiator)
- Multi-role user experience (complete ecosystem)
- Indian market optimizations (target market alignment)

**⚠️ Complexity Concerns:**
- Epic 2B (offline-first multi-device sync) carries highest technical risk
- Bracket generation algorithms may have edge cases requiring investigation
- Cross-platform consistency requirements may impact development timeline

**💡 Potential Scope Refinements:**
- Consider deferring advanced bracket editing features to post-MVP
- SMS backup system could be simplified for initial pilot
- Player profile features could be more basic for MVP

### Technical Readiness

**✅ Clear Technical Guidance:**
- Serverless monolith architecture direction well-defined
- Offline-first requirements clearly articulated
- Indian market technical constraints identified

**⚠️ Areas Requiring Architect Investigation:**
- Real-time synchronization conflict resolution architecture
- Multi-device data consistency implementation approach
- Performance optimization strategies for 2G/3G networks
- SMS gateway integration complexity and cost modeling

**🔍 Identified Technical Risks:**
- Offline sync complexity may exceed single epic scope
- Cross-platform authentication consistency challenges
- Tournament bracket algorithm scalability for large tournaments

### Recommendations

**Before Architect Handoff:**
1. **Validate Key UI Assumptions**: Conduct brief organizer interviews on device preferences and workflow patterns
2. **Technical Risk Assessment**: Have architect review offline-sync complexity and provide implementation feasibility assessment
3. **Performance Criteria Definition**: Establish specific benchmarks for Indian network conditions

**For Architecture Phase:**
1. **Prioritize Offline-First Architecture**: This is the highest complexity technical area requiring careful design
2. **Plan Progressive Feature Rollout**: Consider phased approach to multi-device features
3. **Design for Testability**: Ensure tournament scenarios can be effectively tested in development

**For Development Planning:**
1. **Epic 2B Buffer Planning**: Add 25% buffer to offline-sync epic due to complexity
2. **User Research Integration**: Plan for mid-development user testing with pilot organizers
3. **Performance Testing Strategy**: Include Indian network condition simulation in testing approach

### Final Decision

**NEARLY READY FOR ARCHITECT** - The PRD and epics provide a solid foundation with clear business goals, well-structured requirements, and appropriate MVP scope. The identified gaps are refinements rather than fundamental issues and can be addressed in parallel with early architectural planning.

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt
Review the Mobile Tournament Manager PRD focusing on multi-device user experience and Indian market UX considerations. Create wireframes and user journey flows for organizer dashboard, player schedules, and spectator live viewing. Validate UI assumptions through Indian sports club organizer interviews and iterate designs based on feedback. Priority: Address mobile-first vs tablet-hybrid organizer workflow decisions.

### Architect Prompt
Analyze the Mobile Tournament Manager PRD with emphasis on offline-first multi-device synchronization architecture. Design technical solution for real-time bracket updates, conflict resolution, and data consistency across organizer tablets and referee mobile devices. Assess technical feasibility of Epic 2B complexity and recommend implementation approach or scope adjustments. Priority: Validate offline-sync architecture before Epic planning finalization.
