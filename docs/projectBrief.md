## Project Brief: Mobile Tournament Manager (Final Version)

### Executive Summary
This project will create a unified, mobile-first application for organizing, participating in, and following local racket sports tournaments. It aims to solve the core problem that local club organizers are hampered by outdated, non-collaborative desktop software, which creates a chaotic and unprofessional tournament experience that damages their club's reputation. The target market consists of local sports club organizers, competitive players, and their fans/parents, with an **initial focus on the Indian market**. The key value proposition is to provide a seamless, real-time, and mobile-native platform that makes tournament management simple, professional, and accessible.

### Problem Statement
Tournament management for local clubs currently relies on a fragmented system of Windows-only desktop software, spreadsheets, and manual, word-of-mouth communication. This forces organizers to be tethered to a desk, creating a single-person bottleneck for all administrative tasks. The separation between the management tool and the public website leads to stale information, wasted court time, player anxiety, and constant interruptions for the organizer. The resulting chaotic and unprofessional experience ultimately damages the club's reputation, hindering its ability to attract and retain players. [cite_start]The primary competitor, `TournamentSoftware.com`[cite: 1479], exemplifies this outdated and inefficient model.

### Proposed Solution
The solution is a native mobile application for iOS and Android that unifies all key functionalities—management, participation, and spectating—into a single, intuitive interface. The app's primary differentiators will be its mobile-first design, real-time data synchronization for all users, and an unparalleled ease of use that eliminates the organizer's core pain points. A key feature will be the ability to delegate tasks, such as score entry, to other roles like referees. The system's architecture will be designed with a flexible data model to accommodate future expansion into team-based sports like volleyball and basketball.

### Target Users
* **Primary: "Alex the Club Organizer"**: A time-poor volunteer in **India** who wants to run professional-looking events for his local club and reduce his administrative burden.
* **Secondary: "Maria the Competitive Player"**: A tech-savvy player in **India** who needs a simple mobile interface to track her match schedule and live results.
* **Secondary: "David the Dedicated Fan"**: A parent or fan in **India** who wants to follow a player's progress in real-time, from anywhere.

### Goals & Success Metrics
* **Business Objectives**:
    * Successfully run 3-5 pilot tournaments with local clubs in India in the first 3 months post-launch.
    * Achieve a 4.5+ star rating on the Indian App Store and Google Play Store within 6 months.
* **User Success Metrics**:
    * Reduce an organizer's time spent on manual data entry and answering player questions during a tournament by 50%.
    * Achieve a player Net Promoter Score (NPS) of +50 on the live tournament experience.
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:
    * Daily Active Users (DAU) during tournament weekends in India.
    * Number of tournaments successfully completed using the app.
    * Player retention rate (percentage of players who participate in another tournament on the platform).

### MVP Scope
* **Core Features (Must-Haves)**:
    * [cite_start]**For Organizers**: A dashboard to view their tournaments, a mobile participant list, and a simple interface for mobile score entry that updates brackets in real-time[cite: 1624, 1625, 1627].
    * [cite_start]**For Players**: A personal "My Schedule" view and an interactive, live draw/bracket view[cite: 1634, 1635].
    * [cite_start]**For Spectators**: A live match view for real-time scores and public profiles to provide context on players[cite: 1640, 1642].
* **Out of Scope for MVP**:
    * [cite_start]In-app tournament discovery and search[cite: 1631].
    * [cite_start]In-app registration and payment processing[cite: 1619, 1633].
    * [cite_start]A broadcast communication hub (push notifications)[cite: 1612, 1629].
    * [cite_start]Personalized "Follow" functionality for players/tournaments[cite: 1638].
* **MVP Success Criteria**: The MVP will be successful if it can be used to manage a small, local racket sports tournament in India from the start of the first match to the final result, with organizers and players reporting a significantly more efficient and less stressful experience.

### Post-MVP Vision
* **Phase 2 Features**: Implement the "Should-Have" features, including a full in-app registration and payment flow (using **Indian payment gateways**), a push notification system for organizers, and "follow" functionality for players and fans.
* **Long-term Vision**: To become the leading tournament management platform for the vast, underserved market of non-federation-sanctioned local and social sports events, starting in India and then expanding.
* **Expansion Opportunities**: Evolve the platform's data model and feature set to provide support for team-based sports like volleyball, basketball, and soccer.

### Technical Considerations
* **Platform Requirements**: Native mobile applications for iOS and Android.
* **Technology Preferences**: To be determined by the Architect, but likely a modern, cross-platform framework (like React Native or Flutter) or native Swift/Kotlin, backed by a scalable cloud service like Firebase, AWS Amplify, or Supabase.
* **Integration Requirements**: The MVP must support a CSV import function for player registration data. Post-MVP will require integration with a **payment gateway suitable for the Indian market (e.g., Razorpay, PayU)**.

### Constraints & Assumptions
* **Constraints**: The project will initially operate with a limited budget and an aggressive timeline for the MVP. The platform will not attempt to integrate with official sports federation ranking systems. **The go-to-market and post-MVP payment features will be focused exclusively on India initially.**
* **Key Assumptions**: We assume that a simple CSV import workflow is an acceptable short-term solution for player registration. We assume organizers in India are willing to adopt a new tool if it provides a demonstrably better experience.

### Risks & Open Questions
* **Risks**:
    * **User Adoption**: Organizers may be resistant to changing their established workflows. Our hyper-local, feedback-driven go-to-market strategy is designed to mitigate this.
    * **Data Model Scalability**: The initial data model must be designed thoughtfully to accommodate the future vision of supporting team sports without requiring a complete rewrite.
* **Open Questions**:
    * What are the minimum required data fields for the player registration CSV?
    * How much ruleset and format customization is needed for different racket sports in the MVP?

### Next Steps
1.  Finalize and approve this Project Brief.
2.  Proceed to create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD), focusing on the 7 "Must-Have" MVP features.
3.  Begin initial UX wireframing for the core MVP screens.
