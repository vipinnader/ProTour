# NFR Assessment: Epic 0 - Foundation Setup

Date: 2025-09-03
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - Missing rate limiting validation and security scanning implementation
- Performance: CONCERNS - No performance targets or monitoring baseline 
- Reliability: PASS - Comprehensive error handling and testing infrastructure
- Maintainability: PASS - Strong tooling and code quality measures

## Critical Issues

1. **Security scanning implementation unclear** (Security)
   - Risk: Vulnerabilities may go undetected in foundation
   - Fix: Implement SAST/DAST tools in CI pipeline with clear evidence

2. **No performance baselines** (Performance)  
   - Risk: Build times and CI efficiency unknown
   - Fix: Establish build time targets and monitoring

## Quick Wins

- Define build performance targets: ~1 hour
- Implement basic security scanning: ~4 hours  
- Add performance monitoring to CI: ~2 hours
