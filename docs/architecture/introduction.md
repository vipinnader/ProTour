# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **ProTour**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

After reviewing the PRD, this appears to be a greenfield project without any mention of existing starter templates or codebases. The PRD specifies requirements for a serverless monolith architecture with offline-first capabilities, which suggests a custom implementation rather than building on existing templates.

**Recommendation:** Given the specific requirements for offline-first multi-device synchronization, real-time tournament management, and Indian market optimizations, I recommend starting with a greenfield approach rather than constraining ourselves to existing fullstack templates.
