# Monitoring and Observability

Comprehensive monitoring strategy for ProTour's fullstack tournament management system, focusing on tournament-specific metrics, real-time operational visibility, and Indian market performance optimization.

## Monitoring Stack

- **Frontend Monitoring:** Firebase Crashlytics for crash reporting, Firebase Performance Monitoring for app performance, custom analytics for tournament-specific metrics
- **Backend Monitoring:** Firebase Functions monitoring, Google Cloud Monitoring for infrastructure, Firestore performance monitoring
- **Error Tracking:** Firebase Crashlytics with structured logging, Sentry for additional error context and alerting
- **Performance Monitoring:** Firebase Performance SDK, Google PageSpeed Insights API for web components, custom performance tracking for tournament operations

## Key Metrics

**Frontend Metrics:**
- **Core Web Vitals for Mobile:** First Contentful Paint (<2s), Largest Contentful Paint (<2.5s), First Input Delay (<100ms), Cumulative Layout Shift (<0.1)
- **React Native Specific:** App startup time, memory usage patterns, JavaScript error rates, frame drops during bracket rendering
- **API Response Times:** Tournament operations (<500ms), bracket generation (<2s), score entry acknowledgment (<200ms)
- **User Interactions:** Score entry completion rates, tournament creation success rates, offline sync success rates

**Backend Metrics:**
- **Request Performance:** Request rate by endpoint, error rate by function, response time percentiles (50th, 95th, 99th)
- **Function Health:** Cold start frequency, memory utilization, timeout rates, concurrent execution counts
- **Database Performance:** Firestore read/write operations, query performance, connection pool usage, offline sync conflicts
- **External Dependencies:** SMS gateway response times, Firebase Auth latency, file upload success rates
