# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing mobile apps, web components, and shared backend services to enable rapid iteration and consistent API management across multiple client platforms.

## Service Architecture: Serverless Monolith
Serverless functions within a monorepo structure to support the offline-first, real-time sync requirements while maintaining cost efficiency for MVP budget constraints. Enables automatic scaling during tournament peak loads without infrastructure management overhead.

## Testing Requirements: Full Testing Pyramid
Unit tests for business logic, integration tests for offline-sync mechanisms, and end-to-end tests simulating tournament scenarios across multiple devices. Manual testing protocols for tournament stress conditions and connectivity failure scenarios.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Cross-Platform Mobile Framework**: React Native or Flutter for code reuse across iOS/Android with platform-specific optimizations for performance
- **Offline-First Database**: Local SQLite with cloud sync capabilities (Firebase Firestore offline or similar) to ensure core functionality without connectivity
- **Indian Payment Integration**: Post-MVP integration with Razorpay or PayU for localized payment processing
- **CSV Processing**: Robust client-side CSV parsing with extensive validation and error recovery for player import workflows
- **Multi-Device Sync**: Real-time synchronization architecture supporting organizer tablet + multiple mobile score entry devices
- **Progressive Web App Fallback**: Service worker implementation for basic spectator functionality on unsupported devices
- **SMS Integration**: Notification system using Indian SMS gateways as backup for push notifications
