# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Reduce organizer administrative burden by 50% through automated real-time bracket updates and delegated score entry
- Achieve successful completion of 3-5 pilot tournaments in India within first 3 months post-launch  
- Deliver a 4.5+ star rating on Indian App Store and Google Play Store within 6 months
- Achieve +50 Net Promoter Score from players on live tournament experience
- Create a professional, mobile-first tournament experience that enhances club reputation
- Establish foundation for expansion into team-based sports and broader market reach

## Background Context

Local racket sports tournaments in India currently suffer from a fragmented management ecosystem built around outdated Windows-only desktop software, spreadsheets, and manual communication. This creates a single-person bottleneck where organizers are tethered to desks, resulting in stale public information, wasted court time, and constant player interruptions. The chaotic experience damages club reputations and hinders growth.

Our mobile-first solution addresses this by unifying management, participation, and spectating into a single real-time platform. The focus on the Indian market leverages the underserved local tournament space, with plans for CSV-based player imports initially and future integration with Indian payment gateways like Razorpay.
