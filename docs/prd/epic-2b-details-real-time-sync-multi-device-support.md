# Epic 2B Details: Real-Time Sync & Multi-Device Support

**Epic Goal:** Implement offline-first architecture and multi-device coordination enabling distributed tournament management with reliable synchronization, allowing organizers to delegate score entry while maintaining data consistency across all connected devices.

## Story 2B.1: Offline-First Data Architecture
As an **organizer using multiple devices**,
I want **tournament functionality to work without internet connectivity**,
so that **tournament operations continue smoothly even with unreliable venue internet**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC2B.1.1:** All core tournament operations (score entry, bracket viewing, match management) function completely offline
2. **AC2B.1.2:** Local data storage automatically syncs with cloud when connectivity returns within 30 seconds
3. **AC2B.1.3:** Clear offline/online status indicators showing current connectivity and last sync time
4. **AC2B.1.4:** Conflict resolution system handling simultaneous edits from multiple devices with user-friendly resolution interface
5. **AC2B.1.5:** Data integrity validation ensuring no tournament data corruption during sync processes
6. **AC2B.1.6:** Offline operation time limit of 8 hours with graceful degradation warnings as limit approaches

## Story 2B.2: Multi-Device Score Entry & Delegation
As an **organizer**,
I want **to delegate score entry to referees and assistants using their devices**,
so that **multiple matches can be scored simultaneously without creating bottlenecks**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC2B.2.1:** Organizer invitation system generating secure access codes for referee devices with expiration times
2. **AC2B.2.2:** Role-based permissions allowing referees to enter scores for assigned matches only with match-specific access
3. **AC2B.2.3:** Real-time score entry synchronization appearing on organizer device within 5 seconds when online
4. **AC2B.2.4:** Referee device interface showing only assigned matches with simplified score entry focused on their responsibilities
5. **AC2B.2.5:** Organizer override capability to correct or approve referee-entered scores with audit trail
6. **AC2B.2.6:** Device management dashboard showing connected devices, active referees, and delegation status

## Story 2B.3: Real-Time Tournament Synchronization
As a **tournament participant (organizer, referee, or spectator)**,
I want **live updates of tournament progress across all devices**,
so that **everyone sees current bracket status and match results immediately**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC2B.3.1:** Bracket updates propagating to all connected devices within 3 seconds of score entry when online
2. **AC2B.3.2:** Push notification system alerting relevant users of match completions and bracket progressions
3. **AC2B.3.3:** Synchronization queue management handling multiple simultaneous updates with proper ordering
4. **AC2B.3.4:** Bandwidth optimization ensuring sync operations work effectively on slow mobile connections
5. **AC2B.3.5:** Sync failure recovery with automatic retry mechanisms and user notification of prolonged failures
6. **AC2B.3.6:** Device-specific sync settings allowing users to control notification frequency and data usage

## Story 2B.4: Advanced Conflict Resolution & Data Integrity
As an **organizer managing a distributed tournament**,
I want **intelligent conflict resolution when multiple devices make simultaneous changes**,
so that **tournament data remains consistent and accurate despite complex multi-device scenarios**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **AC2B.4.1:** Automatic conflict detection when two devices modify the same match data simultaneously
2. **AC2B.4.2:** Conflict resolution interface showing competing changes with context and recommendation for resolution
3. **AC2B.4.3:** Organizer priority system ensuring organizer changes take precedence over referee changes in conflicts
4. **AC2B.4.4:** Timestamp-based conflict resolution for non-competing changes with intelligent merge capabilities
5. **AC2B.4.5:** Conflict history log for audit purposes showing all conflicts and their resolutions
6. **AC2B.4.6:** Emergency conflict resolution allowing organizer to reset tournament state to last known good configuration
