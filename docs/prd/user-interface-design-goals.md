# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The application will prioritize reliability and flexibility over innovation, designed for diverse user capabilities and varying technology comfort levels. The interface will support both mobile-native workflows and hybrid mobile+tablet approaches, with offline-first design ensuring functionality during connectivity issues. Progressive complexity allows simple interfaces to expand for advanced scenarios, while maintaining fallback options for technology failures.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Multi-Device Orchestration**: Primary organizer tablet/laptop with mobile companion apps for delegated score entry
- **Progressive Score Entry**: Simple tap interfaces that expand to handle complex scenarios (disputes, corrections, medical timeouts)
- **Offline-First Operations**: Core functionality works without internet, with clear sync status indicators
- **Hybrid Workflow Support**: Digital workflows with paper backup export/import capabilities
- **Accessibility-Enhanced Navigation**: Larger touch targets, high contrast modes, and voice entry options for aging organizer demographic

## Core Screens and Views
- **Multi-Device Organizer Hub**: Tablet-optimized tournament control center with mobile delegation capabilities
- **Adaptive Tournament Brackets**: Responsive display supporting both mobile spectator viewing and tablet management
- **Progressive Score Interface**: Basic tap entry expandable to complex scoring scenarios with validation
- **Player Schedule & Communications**: Mobile-optimized player experience with SMS/offline backup notifications
- **Spectator Live Tracker**: Mobile-first viewing optimized for venue lighting conditions and varying connectivity
- **Enhanced Player Profiles**: Accessible player information with multiple input methods for diverse user capabilities
- **Robust CSV Import System**: Multi-step import with extensive validation, error recovery, and manual override options

## Accessibility: WCAG AA Plus Age-Friendly Design
Beyond WCAG AA compliance, the application will specifically address aging organizer demographics with 150% default text scaling, high contrast modes, and voice input alternatives. Color-blind considerations for match status indicators and large touch targets (minimum 48px) for users with motor skill variations.

## Branding
Professional, trustworthy aesthetic emphasizing reliability over flashiness. Visual hierarchy clearly distinguishes between organizer controls, player information, and spectator content. Offline/connection status prominently displayed to build user confidence in system reliability.

## Target Device and Platforms: Hybrid Multi-Device Strategy
- **Primary**: Native iOS/Android mobile apps for players and spectators
- **Organizer Option 1**: Tablet-optimized native apps for main tournament management
- **Organizer Option 2**: Responsive web app for existing laptop/desktop workflows
- **Fallback**: Progressive Web App for basic functionality across all device types
