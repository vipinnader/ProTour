  configureFallback(conditions: FallbackConditions): Promise<void>
  trackDelivery(messageId: string): Promise<DeliveryStatus>
}

// SMS message templates optimized for Indian mobile users
const SMS_TEMPLATES = {
  matchReady: (playerName: string, opponent: string, court: string) => 
    `ProTour: ${playerName} vs ${opponent} starting soon on Court ${court}. Check app for details.`,
  tournamentDelay: (minutes: number, reason: string) => 
    `ProTour: Tournament delayed ${minutes}min due to ${reason}. Updates in app.`,
  bracketUpdate: (playerName: string, result: string) => 
    `ProTour: ${playerName} ${result}. Next match details in app.`
}
```

### Definition of Done
- [ ] SMS notifications reach users when app notifications fail
- [ ] Message content optimized for tournament information delivery
- [ ] Cost controls prevent excessive SMS charges

- **AC4.3.4:** Memory usage under 200MB during tournaments
- **AC4.3.5:** 8-hour operation consuming <40% battery
- **AC4.3.6:** Data usage tracking and user control

### Performance Optimization
```typescript
interface PerformanceOptimizer {
  optimizeForDevice(deviceSpecs: DeviceSpecs): Promise<OptimizationConfig>
  compressMedia(mediaFiles: MediaFile[]): Promise<CompressedMedia[]>
  monitorMemoryUsage(): MemoryUsageReport
  estimateBatteryUsage(): BatteryUsageEstimate
}
