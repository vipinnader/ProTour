## User Flows

### Organizer Tournament Setup Flow

**User Goal:** Create and populate a new tournament from CSV player data to generate live brackets

**Entry Points:** Home Dashboard > Create Tournament, My Tournaments > New Tournament

**Success Criteria:** Tournament is live with populated brackets, ready for score entry and public viewing

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Select 'Create Tournament'] --> B[Enter Tournament Details]
    B --> C[Choose Tournament Format]
    C --> D[Upload CSV Player List]
    D --> E{CSV Validation}

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

**Purposeful Motion** - Every animation serves a functional purpose: providing feedback, indicating state changes, or guiding user attention. No decoration-only animations.

**Performance-First** - All animations must run smoothly on lower-end Android devices common in Indian market. 60fps target with graceful degradation.

**Respectful of Preferences** - Honor system-level reduced motion preferences. Provide alternative feedback mechanisms for users who disable animations.

**Tournament Context Appropriate** - Subtle, professional animations that work well in busy tournament environments without being distracting or overwhelming.

### Key Animations

- **Score Entry Feedback:** Button press confirmation with haptic feedback and brief scale animation (Duration: 100ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Bracket Update Propagation:** Gentle highlight animation flowing through affected bracket sections when scores update (Duration: 500ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Tournament Status Changes:** Color transition with pulse effect when tournaments go live or complete (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Pull-to-Refresh:** Elegant loading spinner with tournament-themed icon rotation (Duration: continuous, Easing: linear)
- **Match Card State Transitions:** Smooth fade between scheduled/in-progress/completed states (Duration: 250ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Navigation Transitions:** Subtle slide animations between app sections maintaining context (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Error State Recovery:** Gentle shake animation for invalid score entries with color feedback (Duration: 400ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Real-Time Data Sync:** Pulsing connectivity indicator showing live data flow (Duration: 1000ms, Easing: ease-in-out)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals
- **Page Load:** Initial app launch under 3 seconds on 3G networks
- **Interaction Response:** All touch interactions respond within 100ms
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps for all animations on target devices

### Design Strategies

**Progressive Enhancement** - Core functionality works without animations. Enhanced experience with motion for capable devices.

**Efficient Updates** - Real-time bracket updates use minimal DOM manipulation. Component-level state management prevents unnecessary re-renders.

**Network Optimization** - Graceful degradation during poor connectivity. Critical tournament data prioritized over visual enhancements.

**Memory Management** - Animation cleanup prevents memory leaks during long tournament sessions. Efficient bracket rendering for large tournaments.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review and approve this UI/UX specification** with stakeholders and development team
2. **Create detailed visual designs** in Figma covering the 5 key screen layouts defined in wireframes section
3. **Develop interactive prototypes** for critical user flows, especially organizer tournament setup and score entry
4. **Conduct user validation sessions** with target personas (Alex, Maria, David) using prototypes
5. **Hand off to Design Architect** for technical frontend architecture planning
